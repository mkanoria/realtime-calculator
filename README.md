# Realtime Calculator using React, Express and Socket-io

This is a realtime calculator that can be used to share calculations with friends also using the webapp. It uses React (bootstrapped with create-react-app) on the Front End. On the backend, I used Express and Socket to handle the realtime communication.

# Hosting

It's available at https://realtime-calcc.herokuapp.com/

# Building locally

## Front End

Move to the client directory  
`cd client`
Install all dependencies with `npm install`  
Run the app with `yarn start`

## Server

Move to the server directory  
`cd server`
Run `node app.js`

This runs a server at `localhost:4001` - the port can be changed as desired
